Special Senseis are Imaginator dumps manually generated without the necessary signature blocks.
As a result, they donâ€™t function out of the box and require workarounds such as the Error Bypass Dump for consoles or the Digital Signatures Mod for Cemu.
These Special Senseis are primarily used to boost your Imaginator creations to the maximum level of 80.

Special thanks to Echo (@echoseeker715) for creating all these custom Sensei dumps.
