All dump files underwent manual testing within the Cemu emulator to ensure the accuracy of the variants.

One of the Swap Force figures was partially corrupted and it was replaced with a functional one.

Certain figures contained progress data, necessitating their replacement with versions reset to their initial state. However, many Imaginators figures also had progress data. Replacing them with brand new dumps would be time-consuming. Thus, I've retained them with a 'Progress' suffix in their names. This indicates that they possess leveled characters initially, which can be reset after flashing for use with a brand new figure. (Will be fixed in V3)

Three other figures, primarily from older games, also retained some character progress. Their levels are noted in parentheses after their names (e.g., Level 20, Level 5).

Note: Using an emulator to modify Skylanders and then attempting to flash this variant onto a real NFC card may result in corruption in a real game. While recovery is possible, it's a process I aim to avoid. 

All Creation Crystals were refactored, removing redundant ones and those with pre-written characters. Now, each type includes one empty crystal, allowing users to create their own hero.

There has been a major refactoring of image assets, primarily focused on size reduction and eliminating generic redundancy. For instance, each character previously included a round generic element type image, which has been removed. Additionally, many PNG assets were converted to JPG at 100% quality. While JPG adds compression, even at 100% quality, it doesn't significantly impact card printing quality.
