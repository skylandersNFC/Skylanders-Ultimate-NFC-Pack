# General Changes

- V10 update will be also called "Ultimate NFC Pack X"

- Cover image assets have been separated from the "Ultimate NFC Pack" and integrated into the "Skylanders Image Generator" website. If you still need raw image assets for the covers, you can find them in the "Skylanders Extras\Assets\Covers" within the backup cloud space.

- Some of the subfolders were reorganized in a different order to improve ease of use.

# Trap Team

- New image assets for Trappable Villains added, provided by user Dim.

# Imaginators

- "Corrupted Fire Angel.dump" was replaced with a real unreleased "Fire Angel.dump" thanks to BoomBringer.

- New "Premade Characters" have been added, thanks to our amazing community members.
