- Assets refactoring inside the “9) Traps” folder. Some images were inside the wrong elements.
- All “2) Crystal Trap Variants” have been reset, removing the villains from them. You can still catch them in the game, but now you can also use the legendary traps to catch other villains.
- “4) Trappable Villain Variants > Steamed Broccoli Guy” was renamed to “Steamed (Evolved) Broccoli Guy.dump” since we only have evolved version of him.
- “Doom Raider” suffix added to the following trappable villains:

	Chef Pepper Jack (Doom Raider)
	
	Chompy Mage (Doom Raider)
	
	Dr. Krankcase (Doom Raider)
